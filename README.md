#L4 User and Permission Management
##Introduction
A user management and permission management module on top of the Sentry (by cartalyst) module. This module uses all the functionalities core to Sentry module, but just it give you a UI like the Drupalâ€™s permission matrix to manage things a bit easily.

The markup of the UI is Bootstrap layout so the markup can fit in well with any other Bootstrap theme or even if someone is writing their own CSS.

The requirements for this package is same as what Sentry module has.
